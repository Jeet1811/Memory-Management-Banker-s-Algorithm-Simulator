ðŸ§  Memory Allocation Project

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The Memory Allocation Project simulates dynamic memory allocation using various allocation strategies, including First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, and Next Fit. The web-based interface allows users to input the number of processes and memory blocks, then allocate memory based on the selected strategy. Results are visualized with details on internal and external fragmentation.

ðŸŒŸ Features
Dynamic User Input: Specify the number of processes and memory blocks with corresponding sizes.
Multiple Allocation Strategies: First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, Next Fit
Detailed Output:
Allocation results for each process
Internal and external fragmentation visualization
Memory block visualization with assigned processes
Interactive UI: Simple and intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
